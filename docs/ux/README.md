# UX Wireframes Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains UX wireframes that define the structure and user flow of the Internet Shop application.

## File Organization

Wireframes should be organized by screen/feature:

```
docs/ux/
├─ README.md
├─ home-page.png (or .pdf, .sketch, etc.)
├─ product-list.png
├─ product-form.png
└─ ...
```

## Wireframe Guidelines

### What to Include

- **Layout structure**: Header, main content, footer
- **Component placement**: Where product cards, forms, buttons are located
- **User flow**: How users navigate between screens
- **Interaction points**: Buttons, links, form fields
- **Information hierarchy**: What information is most important

### Tools

Wireframes can be created using:
- **uxpilot.ai**: AI-powered wireframe generation
- **Figma**: Design tool
- **Balsamiq**: Wireframing tool
- **Pen and paper**: Scanned or photographed

### File Naming

Use descriptive names:
- `home-page.png`
- `product-list.png`
- `product-form-create.png`
- `product-form-edit.png`
- `empty-state.png`

## Current Status

Wireframes are to be added during the design phase. This directory serves as a placeholder for future wireframe files.

## Integration with Design

Wireframes inform the UI design process:
1. Wireframes define structure and flow
2. Design brief (`docs/design-brief.md`) defines visual style
3. UI mockups (`docs/ui/`) provide visual reference
4. Implementation follows these references
